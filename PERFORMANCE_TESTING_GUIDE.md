✅ No unnecessary re-renders
✅ Smooth animations without lag
✅ Optimistic updates work instantly
```

**How to Test:**
1. Use React DevTools Profiler
2. Click like buttons rapidly
3. Check for minimal re-renders
4. Verify like animation is instant

### **Test 9: Component Isolation**
```bash
# Expected Behavior:
✅ EpisodeCard components are isolated
✅ State changes don't affect other cards
✅ Memory usage is optimized
```

**How to Test:**
1. Open multiple episode cards
2. Interact with different cards
3. Verify changes are isolated
4. Check memory usage stays low

## 🌐 **5. Network Optimization Tests**

### **Test 10: Pagination**
```bash
# Expected Behavior:
✅ Loads 10 episodes at a time
✅ Smooth infinite scroll
✅ No loading delays
```

**How to Test:**
1. Scroll to bottom of list
2. Verify more episodes load automatically
3. Check loading indicator appears briefly
4. Verify smooth transition

### **Test 11: Debounced Operations**
```bash
# Expected Behavior:
✅ No excessive API calls during scroll
✅ Smooth performance during rapid scrolling
✅ Operations are debounced properly
```

**How to Test:**
1. Scroll rapidly up and down
2. Check network tab for API calls
3. Verify calls are debounced
4. Check console for scroll logs

## ⚡ **6. Animation Performance Tests**

### **Test 12: 60fps Animations**
```bash
# Expected Behavior:
✅ All animations run at 60fps
✅ No frame drops during animations
✅ Smooth spring physics
```

**How to Test:**
1. Use React Native Debugger Performance tab

✅ Cache cleanup: "🧹 Cache cleanup"
✅ Performance: "🎬 Episode player"
✅ No error logs for video playback
```

## 🚨 **9. Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: Frame Drops**
**Solution:** Check if `removeClippedSubviews` is enabled for Android

### **Issue: Memory Leaks**
**Solution:** Verify cleanup functions are called on unmount

### **Issue: Video Loading Delays**
**Solution:** Check if preloading is working and cache is functioning

### **Issue: Multiple Videos Playing**
**Solution:** Verify `isActive` and `isVisible` logic is correct

### **Issue: Slow Scrolling**
**Solution:** Check FlatList optimization settings
