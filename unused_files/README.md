## üéØ Why These Files Were Moved

1. **Simplified Architecture**: The current app uses a simpler, more stable video player (`SimpleVideoPlayer.js`)
2. **Performance**: Removed complex memoization and optimization that was causing re-rendering issues
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with fewer unused files
4. **Testing**: Test files and screens were only used during development
5. **Documentation**: Outdated documentation that doesn't reflect current implementation

## üîß How to Restore Files

If you need to restore any of these files:

1. **Move back to original location**: `mv unused_files/filename.ts src/original/path/`
2. **Update imports**: Fix any import statements that reference these files
3. **Test functionality**: Ensure the restored files work with current implementation

## üìù Notes

- All files are preserved and can be restored if needed
- The current implementation focuses on stability and simplicity
- Future optimizations can be added back gradually as needed
- Documentation can be updated to reflect current implementation
